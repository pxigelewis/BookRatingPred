# BookRatingPred

This is a very much unfinished project that I'm currently working on! The goal of this project is to be able to predict what I will rate a given book based on data I've collected from books I've previously read.

So far I've done some visualization of the data I have to get a good idea of what factors most impact my ratings, and from there I'm working on implementing an NLP model for the predictions.

In the end, I hope to make this into a fully functioning application that anyone can use to predict their book ratings! Check back soon for more updates 🙂
